Data Analyzer is an application built in Python that interpolates an inputted .CSV file, sorts the data, performs polynomial regression, and displays the plotted data with a line or curve of best fit. 
## Features

- Loads the data stored in the .CSV file and displays the data in a different format depending on which sub-function is called.
- Uses unit testing to confirm the program will run as expected without syntax or logical errors.
- Sorts the data from the .CSV file using two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
- Plots the sorted data as histograms depending on the desired independent and dependent variables of the graphs.
- Performs regression techniques based on the graphs data to display a line or curve of best fit. 
- Determines the maximum and minimum value of the line or curve of best fit for the desired graphs.
- Uses a text user interface and batch user interface

## Installation
Install the _.zip_ file titled _T078_data_analyzer.zip_ to get access on the computer to the  "Data Analyzer" application. Unzip the file using an unzip applications (i.e. 7-Zip) to have the uncompressed version of the _T078_data_analyzer_ folder. 


## Usage
From a terminal 'cd' in to the directory where the files are extracted. The 'ls' command should output the following

```bash
ls
```
```bash
